  * Normalizes interface_normal with the 1-norm just as mycs
  
  The function interface_normal is defined in fraction as mycs whose norm is the 1-norm.
  We redefine it here to use the height functions, but height_normal norm is the 2-norm.
  For consistency, it seems more reasonable to not change the norm return by a same function.
